DustBin is a simple Java game that gives you a pixel sandbox environment to interact with to your heart's content! All the elements interact with each other in unique ways and follow simple gravity and fluid simulation. Youâ€™re able to create and save levels for later use or to share them with others. There is a slider at the bottom that can be used to slow down or speed up time within the game as well. This game was originally made for an AP CS class and has no plans for future updates.

**Installation** 

Download the zip on [GitHub][dustbin-git] or [Itch][dustbin-itch]. Once the zip is extracted, launch the DustBin.exe to start the game.

**Notes** 
- The download is quite large due to the JRE needing to be included to work on machines that don't already have Java installed
- Levels are automatically saved within the same directory that the DustBin.exe file is in
- Level files can be renamed after they are saved manually
- Levels must be loaded from the same directory that the DustBin.exe file is in
