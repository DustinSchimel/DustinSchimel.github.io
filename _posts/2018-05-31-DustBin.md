DustBin is a simple Java game that provides a pixel sandbox environment for you to interact with to your heart's content! All the elements interact with each other in unique ways and follow basic gravity and fluid simulation. You can create and save levels for later use or to share with others. There is also a slider at the bottom that allows you to slow down or speed up time within the game.

**Installation** 

Download the zip on my [Itch][dustbin-itch] or [GitHub][dustbin-git]. Once the zip is extracted, launch the DustBin.exe to start the game.

**Notes** 
- The download is quite large because the JRE needs to be included to work on machines that don't already have Java installed.
- Levels are automatically saved in the same directory as the DustBin.exe file.
- Level files can be renamed manually after they are saved.
- Levels must be loaded from the same directory as the DustBin.exe file.
