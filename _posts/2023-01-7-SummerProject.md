SummerProject was my first attempt at creating a multiplayer game in Unity. The goal was to develop a multiplayer 2D platformer where players could compete to achieve the best time on each stage. Although it remains unfinished and I don't plan to work on it further, it provided me with valuable experience in developing multiplayer games.

Hereâ€™s a video showcasing the work I did on the controller-supported menus.

Here's a video showcasing the early gameplay and multiplayer functionality.

**Installation** 

Download the zip on my [Github][sp-git]. Once the zip is extracted, launch the SummerProject.exe to start the game.

**Instructions** 

Singleplayer is a good way to get a feel for the game and its mechanics outside of multiplayer. If you want to try playing multiplayer, you can still do so! Just host a game on one client, and you can connect to that game from another client using the code provided in-game. This works both locally and non-locally, as it uses peer-to-peer hosting provided by Unity Relay.

**Controls**

Menus
 - WASD
 - Arrow keys
