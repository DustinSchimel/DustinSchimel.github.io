SummerProject was my first attempt at making a multiplayer game in Unity. The goal was to make a multiplayer 2D platformer where you could compete with other players in order to get the best time on each stage. It's unfinished and I don't see myself working on it further, but it did give me some experience with working on multiplayer games.

Here's a video showcasing the work I did on the controller supported menus.

Here's a video showcasing the early gameplay and multiplayer functionality.

**Installation** 

Download the zip on [Github][sp-git]. Once the zip is extracted, launch the SummerProject.exe to start the game.

**Instructions** 

Singeplayer is a good way to get a feel for the game and it's mechanics outside of multiplayer. If you want to try and play multiplayer, you still can! Just host a game on one client and you can connect to that game from another client using the code it will give you in-game. This works locally and non-locally since it uses peer-to-peer hosting provided by Unity Relay.

**Controls**
