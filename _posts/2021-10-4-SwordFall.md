SwordFall is a simple, high-score-based endless falling game where you try to stay alive while using your sword to parry off spikes, which gives you a boost upward. You must maneuver around spike-covered platforms and toxic mushrooms to survive. This game was made in two days for our game development club’s game jam. Although I wish we had more time to work on it, I’m happy with the result we achieved despite the time constraints. During this project, most of us worked together on the engineering team, so I had the opportunity to work on all aspects of the game, including the physics, sounds, animations, dynamic foreground, UI, and dynamic platforms.

**Installation** 

Download the zip on [Itch][swordfall-itch] or [GitHub][swordfall-git]. Once the zip is extracted, launch the SwordFall.exe to start the game.

**Instructions** 

Use the left and right arrow keys to move horizontally, and press the down key to swing your sword.
