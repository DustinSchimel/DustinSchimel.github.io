SwordFall is a really simple high-score based endless falling game where you try to stay alive while using your sword to parry off spikes to give you a boost upward. You must maneuver around the spike covered platforms and toxic mushrooms in order to stay alive. This game was made in two days for our game development club's game jam. Although I wish we had a lot more time to work on it, I'm happy with the result we came to despite the time restriction. During this project most of us worked together on the engineering team so I got to work with all aspects of the game including the physics, sounds, animations, dynamic foreground, UI, and the dynamic platforms.

**Installation** 

Download the zip on [GitHub][swordfall-git] or [Itch][swordfall-itch]. Once the zip is extracted, launch the SwordFall.exe to start the game.

**Instructions** 

Use the left and right arrow keys to move horizontally, and press the down key to swing your sword.
