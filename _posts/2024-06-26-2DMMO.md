2DMMO is a multiplayer side-scrolling platformer game that I'm currently working on within Unity. The project is still really early in development. But as of right now, I have server-authoritative movement that stops players from manipulating their movement in unintended ways. I also have AI that currently patrols around the area waiting to be attacked by the player (coming soon). 

**How To Play** 

You can play the game right below this text, on my [website][2dmmolink], or on my [Itch][itchlink] page. If you play on this website, please be aware that the screen size is smaller than intended, so things may look a little off (there is a fullscreen button in the bottom right to help as well). If you decide to play here, just hit the <b>Start Client</b> button to start the game once itâ€™s loaded. If the game is laggy, make sure to enable hardware acceleration in your browser settings.
