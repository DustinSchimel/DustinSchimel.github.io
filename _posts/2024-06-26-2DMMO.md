2DMMO is a multiplayer sidescrolling platformer game that I'm currently working on within Unity. The project is still really early in development. But as of right now, I have server-authoritative movement that stops player's from manipulating their movement in unintended ways. I also have AI that currently patrols around the area waiting to be attacked by the player (coming soon). 

**How To Play** 

Just head to my website [website][2dmmolink] and you can play the game using Unity WebGL. Once it's loaded just hit the button in the top left to start the client. If the game is laggy at all, make sure to enable hardware acceleration on your browser.
