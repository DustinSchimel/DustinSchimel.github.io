2DMMO is a multiplayer side-scrolling platformer game that I'm currently working on within Unity. The project is still really early in development. But as of right now, I have server-authoritative movement that stops players from manipulating their movement in unintended ways. I also have AI that currently patrols around the area waiting to be attacked by the player. 

**How To Play** 

You can play the game right below this text, on the dedicated [website][2dmmolink], or on my [Itch][itchlink] page. If you play on this website, please be aware that the <b>screen size is smaller than intended</b>, so things may look a little off (there is a <b>fullscreen button in the bottom right</b> to make it normal). <b>If the game is laggy</b>, make sure to <b>enable hardware acceleration</b> in your browser settings.

**Instructions** 

Use the left and right arrow keys or the A and W keys to move horizontally, and press the space bar to jump. You can use shift to attack and Z to pick up items (although the items have no use yet).
