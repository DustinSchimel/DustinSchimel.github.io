2DMMO, as it's currently named, is a multiplayer side-scrolling RPG that I'm working on within Unity. The project is still really early in development, but I still have quite a bit to show of it. 2DMMO is being developed for web browsers and PC/Mac/Linux.

**Features**

- Multiplayer
- Account system
- Guest login system
- Server-authoritative movement
- Anti-cheat
- Enemy AI
- Interactive UI
- Level system
- Combat

**How To Play** 

You can play the game right below this text, on the dedicated [website][2dmmolink], or on my [Itch][itchlink] page. If you play on this website, please be aware that the <b>screen size is smaller than intended</b>, so things may look a little off (there is a <b>fullscreen button at the bottom right of the player</b> to make it normal). <b>If the game is laggy</b>, make sure to <b>enable hardware acceleration</b> in your browser settings.

**Instructions** 

If you're playing for the first time, I'd recommend pressing the <b>Information</b> button at the bottom left of the main menu to learn about the game and it's controls. If you'd rather learn about that information here, I can make that work as well. Press the <b>Play as Guest</b> button below the login input fields in order to start playing. Once you're in the game, you can refer to the controls below in order to play. 

**Controls**

<b>Movement</b>
- Running: A/D and Left Arrow/Right Arrow
