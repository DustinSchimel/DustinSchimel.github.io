2DMMO is a multiplayer side-scrolling platformer game that I'm currently working on within Unity. The project is still really early in development. But as of right now, I have server-authoritative movement that stops players from manipulating their movement in unintended ways. I also have AI that currently patrols around the area waiting to be attacked by the player (coming soon). 

**How To Play** 

You can play the game right below this text, going to my [website][2dmmolink], or by playing on my [Itch][itchlink] page. Once it's loaded, just hit the button in the top left labeled '<b>Start Client</b>' to start the game. If the game is laggy at all, make sure to enable hardware acceleration on your browser.
