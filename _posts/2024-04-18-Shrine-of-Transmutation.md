Shrine of Transmutation is a mod for the game [Risk of Rain 2][ror2-steam]. This mod adds a new interactable structure to the game that you can offer your items to for a chance to reroll them, upgrade them, downgrade them, or even delete them if you're unlucky.

Risk of Rain 2 is one of my favorite games and being able to make a mod for it was really fun and taught me a lot! I gained a lot of experience working with APIs that I'm unfamiliar with and expanding on projects/games that I didn't make.

**Installation** 

You need to own [Risk of Rain 2][ror2-steam] and download the mod from the [Thunderstore][thnderstre] page. The mod can also be found on [GitHub][gthb]. I would recommend using the Mod Manager for ease of download and installation.
