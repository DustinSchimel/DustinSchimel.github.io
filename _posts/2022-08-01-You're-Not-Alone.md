This game was developed by a group of 5 students over a span of 12 weeks for class. Developed with the intent to have alternative value besides just being a fun game to play. This was my first time developing a 2D game and my main focuses were on player movement, checkpoints, controller support, audio, dialogue, menus, and WebGL support. I gained a lot of experience by working on this project and I'm very happy with how it turned out.
