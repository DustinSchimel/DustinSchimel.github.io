This game was developed by a group of 4 students over a span of 11 weeks for a VR class. We were tasked with creating a VR project using Unity and we chose to make a game since most of us want to make games in the future. This was my first time developing a VR game and I learned a great deal about VR development as a result. My main focuses on the project were the VR controls, spear mechanics, and the rope mechanics within the game.
