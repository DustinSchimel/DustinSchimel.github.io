Minor Scale was my very first large-scale team game that took place over the course of 2 semesters. Itâ€™s a simple rhythm game combined with tower defense features and a cute 2D/3D hybrid aesthetic.

This was my first time using Unreal Engine and Perforce. My main tasks during the project were related to enemy types, enemy waves, rebindable controls and UI.

### Enemy types
All of the enemies are children of a parent class with slight variations added to account for their stats or special abilities. These stats are taken from a data table that the enemy designers can easily change and play around with. They follow a simple spline that can be made by the level designers. They have methods for things like taking damage, taking damage over time, being slowed and more that the tower creation team can utilize when making their types of towers. Below is a picture of enemies moving down a simple spline.

### Enemy Waves
This is where the bulk of my time was spent during this project. I wanted to make a system similar to [Bloons TD 6][bloons-steam] where the enemies come out in groups of the same type with breaks between spawns and then it switches to different types of enemies. I created a system that allowed the designers to play with values within a data table for the waves in order to see what worked. Everything about the waves can be changed including enemy types spawned, how many enemies spawn in each group, time before the group spawns, time between spawns in the same group, cash reward for clearing each wave depending on the difficulty, and which path they go down (if there are multiple paths). Below is a picture of part of the wave data table for level 1.

### Rebindable Controls
This was something we actually didn't plan on adding to the game, but I had an opening in my tasks and decided to take this on. I was very happy that I did, since I was able to make our game more accessible to more groups of people. All the controls within the game can be rebound besides mouse controls. This even enables the game to be played on things like Steam Deck!

### UI
I created our main menu, pause menus, and the in-game UI. I tried to make them as fluid and polished as possible. The in-game 3D UI updates dynamically depending on what the incoming wave is, how much money the player has, and how many lives they have left. The first video above shows the 3D UI inside the level, while the video below shows the main menu and rebindable controls.
