Raptor Randomizer is a Java Applet that randomizes League of Legends champions, item builds, runes, and summoner spells. It was inspired by a website called Ultimate Bravery, which does mostly the same thing but in a web format. This was made for an AP CS class and was my final project. There are no plans on updating this, and it's basically unusable for current League of Legends since it was made for season 8. There is no downloadable build available, but there is a video included below of it working, and if you really want to build it the code is available on [GitHub][raptor-git].

Due to this being one of my first projects, there is a lot of redundant code. But, it still has some cool things going on. There is a lot of conditional statements that determine how exactly your build will be made. This is because in League of Legends you might only be able to buy 1 type of item, or only being able to choose runes from a certain page.
