Raptor Randomizer is a Java Applet that randomizes League of Legends champions, item builds, runes, and summoner spells. It was inspired by a website called Ultimate Bravery, which does mostly the same thing but in a web format. It randomizes the way you can play League of Legends and can make for a fun way to play with friends. This was made for an AP CS class and was my final project. There are no plans on updating this, and it's basically unusable for current League of Legends since it was made for season 8.

Due to this being one of my first projects, there is a lot of redundant code. But, it still has some cool things going on. There is a lot of conditional statements that determine how exactly your build will be made. This is because in League of Legends you might only be able to buy 1 type of item, or only being able to choose runes from a certain page.


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
