Dream Planet was developed by a team of six for a semester-long class at our school. It was created with the intention of teaching us about Unity and game development. It was our first game, and we are proud of how it turned out. My role within the team was as the head engineer for player movement, collectibles, and dialogue systems within the game. I also resolved many of our version control issues (which sparked my future interest in Perforce) and prevented countless hours of our team having to redo work.
