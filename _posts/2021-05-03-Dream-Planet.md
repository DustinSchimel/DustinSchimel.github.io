Play on a magical, dream-like planet, exploring far-off lands and interacting with intriguing creatures! Be careful thoughâ€”some may be dangerous. Your goal is to find the missing pieces of your broken rocket ship to get off the planet and head home. Can you find them all?

Dream Planet was developed by a team of six for a semester-long class at our school. It was created with the intention of teaching us about Unity and game development. It was our first game, and we are proud of how it turned out. My role within the team was as the head engineer for player movement, collectibles, and dialogue systems within the game. I also resolved many of our version control issues (which sparked my future interest in Perforce) and prevented countless hours of our team having to redo work.

**Installation** 

Once the zip is extracted, launch the Dream Planet.exe to start the game.

You can play the game right below this text or on our [Itch][dreamplanet-itch] page. If you play on this website, please be aware that the <b>screen size is smaller than intended</b>, so things may look a little off (there is a <b>fullscreen button in the bottom right</b> to help too). <b>If the game is laggy, make sure to enable hardware acceleration in your browser settings</b>. The downloadable version is the preferred version to play on, but the web version is completely serviceable on it's own.
