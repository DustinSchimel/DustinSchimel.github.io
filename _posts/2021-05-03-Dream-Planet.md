Dream Planet was my first game made during college. We formed teams within the class (mine being a 6 person team) and our goal was a Unity game at the end, that's it. 


It was developed with the intent on teaching our team about Unity and game development within a team setting. My roll within the team was as the head engineer for player movement, collectibles, and dialogue systems within the game. 

and taught me a lot about using Unity and game development in a team setting. I was the head engineer for player movement, collectibles, and dialogue systems within the game. 

**Installation** 

Download the zip on [GitHub][dustbin-git] or [Itch][dustbin-itch]. Once the zip is extracted, launch the DustBin.exe to start the game.

**Notes** 
- The download is quite large due to the JRE needing to be included to work on machines that don't already have Java installed
- Levels are automatically saved within the same directory that the DustBin.exe file is in
- Level files can be renamed after they are saved manually
- Levels must be loaded from the same directory that the DustBin.exe file is in
