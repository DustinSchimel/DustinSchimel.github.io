Omok Deluxe was another attempt at creating a multiplayer game in Unity. The goal was to recreate Omok as it appears in [Maplestory][maple] but in a classic setting (~2004). Progress was going well until I realized that I might not be able to publish the game due to using Nexonâ€™s IP and assets, even if I was not making money from it. As a result, I decided to scrap the project early in development before the multiplayer functionality was fully developed.

I'm very happy with how the aesthetics of the game turned out before I stopped development. The UIs I created work exactly as they do in-game, and all the sounds come together well. The gameplay also works as intended and can be played offline, as long as you take turns using the same computer haha.

**Installation** 

I sadly can't post the GitHub or Itch pages.
