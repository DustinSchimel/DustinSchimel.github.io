Omok Deluxe was another attempt at making a multiplayer game in Unity. The goal was to recreate Omok as it is in [Maplestory][maple] but in a classic setting (~2004). Progress was going well until I began to realize I might not be able to publish this game due to using Nexon's IP and assets even if I was not making money from it. So I decided to scrap the project early into development before multiplayer functionality got fully developed.

I'm very happy with how the aethestics of the game came out before I stopped development. The UIs that I made work exactly as they do in-game and all the sounds come together well. The gameplay works as intended as well, and can be played offline as long as you take turns using the same computer haha.

**Installation** 

I sadly can't post the GitHub or Itch pages.
