You're Not Alone is a game about the internal struggles people have in their daily lives and the constant struggle of coming to terms with them. You're Not Alone follows a young child whose life and personal flaws deters them from being happy. Through conversations with those around him does he know that he truly isn't alone.

This game was developed by a group of five students over a span of twelve weeks for class. It was developed with the intent of having value beyond just being a fun game to play. This was my first time developing a 2D game, and my main focuses were on player movement, checkpoints, controller support, audio, dialogue, menus, and WebGL support. I gained a lot of experience working on this project and am very happy with how it turned out.

**Disclaimer**

Youâ€™re Not Alone tackles one of many different backgrounds that people may experience in their lives, including anxiety, depression, worries, and woes. Please know that you are valued, and sometimes reaching out to a loved one can help.

**Installation** 

You can play the game right below this text or on our [Itch][yourenotalone-itch] page. If you play on this website, please be aware that the screen size is smaller than intended, so things may look a little off (there is a fullscreen button in the bottom right to help too). If you do decide to play here, just hit the <b>Play</b> button to start the game once it's loaded. If the game is laggy, make sure to enable hardware acceleration in your browser settings.
