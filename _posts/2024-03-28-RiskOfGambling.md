Risk of Gambling is a mod being worked on for the game [Risk of Rain 2][ror2-steam]. The mod adds a new interactable structure to the game that you can use to gamble with your items. Your items can be upgraded, rerolled, or even deleted if you are unlucky.

It's nearing completion, I just need to work further on the 3D model and sound effects. What I'm trying to get out of this project is more experience working with APIs that I'm unfamiliar with and expanding on projects/games that I didn't make. I've really learned a lot from this project and it's made me want to make even more mods for games such as Lethal Company and Minecraft!

**Installation** 

The mod currently isn't ready for installation since I'm still actively working on it. It'll be released on [Thunderstore][thnderstre] once it's ready! I'm hoping to get it released before the Seekers of the Storm DLC drops.
